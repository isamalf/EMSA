# EMSA
This script allows me to receive email alerts about stocks of my choosing. For example QQQ, if it drops below a certain price I will be able to receive an automatic alert from my script. I have uploaded all the source code necessary in order for the script to run, I have also provided the required projects that you must import into the code in order to have everything function as normal. The script can easily be changed for other individuals personal use.
